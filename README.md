# Aerospace Enterprise Stuff
This is a collection of programs and tools that I created durnig my time at [Michigan Technological University](mtu.edu) as part of the [Aerospace Enterprise](http://aerospace.mtu.edu/enterprise/).

During my time on the Enterprise I was a Project Engineer for 2 semesters, the Spring and Summer of 2018. The Fall of 2018 I was the ADC System Engineer in training. For the rest of my time at MTU I was the ADC System Engineer of the Aerospace Enterprise.

This is not everything I created, but it is the stuff that I retain the copyright over.
# Details
I removed the names of items and manufacturers that were in Excel sheets or other places. Everything is generic so you can just insert whatever you want into it.
# License
I chose the GPLv3 for the licensing of these tools. This means anyone can freely use these tools as much as they want and not have to doing anything. That means if you work somewhere and would like to use one of these tools you can. __But__ if you want to distribute any of these tools (i.e. change it and want to give it to someone else) you must distribute it under the GPLv3 as well. That means you can edit it internally of your organization as much as you want and not worry, as that is not distribution.
