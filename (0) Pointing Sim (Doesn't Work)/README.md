A MATLAB simulation made in the Spring of 2018 to attempt to model satellite attitude dynamics. It doesn't work (as I was a freshman and didn't know what I was doing) but was a good attempt.

It uses some math I made up in my second semester as a freshman as well as using equation detailed in Space Mission Analysis and Design. It produced some pretty lookin graphs at one point. I'm not sure if it still does. Please do not use this.

Some of this uses some fun concepts like parralell processing in MATLAB, which is surprisingly easy and between consecutive runs doesn't have too much overhead. The primary overhead is when you start the parrellel processing library which has a 30 second to 1 minute startup time.
