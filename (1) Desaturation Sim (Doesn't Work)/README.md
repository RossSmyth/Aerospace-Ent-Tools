# Desturation Simulation
Only here for my own historical preservation purposes. Please don't look at or use.

A MATLAB simulation made in the Spring of 2018 to attempt to model satellite desaturation attitude dynamics. It doesn't work as I was a freshman and didn't know what I was doing, but was a good attempt.
