# Pointing-Simulation
Here for my own historical preservation purposes. Please don't look at or use as it doesn't work at all.

A Python simulation made in the Spring of 2018 to attempt to model satellite attitude dynamics. It is a rewrite of the previous one into Python as MATLAB is slow. It doesn't work as I was a clueless freshman, but was a good attempt.

It uses some math I made up in my second semester as a freshman as well as using equation detailed in Space Mission Analysis and Design. It produced some pretty lookin graphs at one point. I'm not sure if it still does. Please do not use this.
